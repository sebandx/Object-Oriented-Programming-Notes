## What is an Object?
* In OOP, and object is a combination of data and functional code
* Like real-world objects, objects in OOP have states and behavior
* 
## Object Oriented Programming
* For creating modular, reusable software. 
* Designs programs through creating Objects which you can provide functionality to
* Focuses on the definition of data
Object's Data -> attributes
Object's Code -> methods
## Classes and Objects
Class -> A class is a a template for creating objects. It is a user-defined data type that contains data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data.
* Attributes are an objects accessible tools. 
* Fields are variables which belong to an object or class
    * Type 1: belongs to an instance of a class
    * Type 2: belongs to the class itself
* Methods are functions that the object can call
Note: Class names are capitalized 
## __init__ method and self parameter
* Executed as soon as an object of the class is intiated
* Allows us to intialize an objects attributes
* self denotes that the method is accessible for the object itself
* self attributes are treated as local
